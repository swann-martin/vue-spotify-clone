# spotify-clone

This project was made following a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzuqwqP1wAQ) from the channel [John Weeks Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@johnweeksdev). The aim was to make a spotify clone using Vue 3, pinia, tailwind and assets musics. I just wanted to learn more about Vue.
